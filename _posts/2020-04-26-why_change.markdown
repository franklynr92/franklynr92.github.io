<h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">**Why change?**</h1>
<br>
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Beginnings</h2>
<br>
I currently work in a semi-affluent branch. I have been working for the bank for about five years and I have been in the finance industry for six.<br>
<br>
On the daily my goal is to always find a way to better myself. My mentality is to continually self-improve, so I at least try to learn one new thing a day. With banking I find it difficult to accomplish this goal or find a new challenge.

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Journey</h2>

When I first started this journey into banking it was like any other job I had. When I first started in banking, I did not believe there was a future in it for me because of the status I was currently at. I couldn't tell you if it was mentally or just the location itself, but I just couldn't see it.<br>
I was fresh out of college, just graduated with a finance degree and the job search was tough, I had a few hurdles with some jobs. Some I just could not do because it was not mentally challenging, and some were in the process of closing. When I came into banking, I rushed in wanting to secure some kind-of work to do. To be honest the entry level position I was in I found mundane and I was capping myself.<br>
<br>
It was at this time I took advantage of the philosophy course I took in college, *cough three times cough*. I started to question what my purpose in my life was, where exactly I fit in, where is my place. I started to ask myself all these questions so to find the answer I investigated with google. I started researching different careers, different courses to take online. I came about a comprehensive web development course that taught, html, CSS, and JavaScript. I had fun with that course and started looking upon what else I can learn. I started to freelance and make some websites with a friend. <br>
<br>
It got to a point where we started to get overwhelmed because of the knowledge we lacked. We were ignorant to the fact of how much work is required for these higher-level jobs. I heard about coding bootcamps, but I was not positive it was the route for me. As a finance person I was not willing to take the risk in myself. So, I had given up the route to be a software engineer and put more of my focus to my current job. It was also at this point in my life where an opportunity came about for a promotion at my current job. <br>

<br>
<br>

For a time in my career in banking I did find daily challenges there and things to work on. With the experiences gained, I found ways to better conversate and find benefit in the products used to serve my clientele. I gave myself sales goals and objections to beat. I kept pushing forward with this because I truly believed this was my path. As I went on, getting recognized and promoted, I had felt this was it. Yet, even with this upward growth I still found myself limited on what I can do. Then certain things had come to light.<br>
<br>
I have noticed that a lot more banks were closing branches and adding more machines to service people. I started to question when my bank will follow suit. Shortly after this, my bank started pushing out more towards having clients doing everything online. They started rolling out promotions to teach people how to use online features, make transactions, using ATM's, etc. It was when this started happening that I knew for sure that, sooner or later, my bank will start having more machines and less people.

<br>


The journey that it has taken me on has helped better me as a professional and as a person. Having that as my career has changed my perspective, opening my eyes, bringing to light certain issues at hand. The issue was that I found myself with more restrictions and less freedom to be creative with solving problems. I started to ask those questions again, from when I first began my journey. Even so, I was still unsure where to take my path next.

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Awakenings</h2>

A few weeks before the pandemic started, I had a key event happen in my life. I had the chance to meet someone who had graduated from a bootcamp class. They had expressed to me about their coding journey. I was able to get some insight about what they do now and their salary. They told me about the promotions they have received and how much more they are going to get paid. When it comes to money for me, seeing is believing, and when this person showed me paystubs trust me, I believed. They also spoke about their work atmosphere and how they are not micromanaged.

This started to get my gears working.

The fire that lit the candle in my pursuit to Software Engineering was when... 

Fast-forward into being stuck at home. I started looking at some online courses, taking them just to refresh myself. I wanted to make sure that this was the path to take my life in. I found myself enjoying creating with code. Doing different projects online, changing the code to react to different actions was fun. Seeing what can really be done with coding has sparked a creative fire in me that I yearn to keep lit. I thoroughly enjoy the thought of being able to create and leave something behind. There are so many different ideas I want to implement, and the more I learn, the more I feel coding can accomplish this. 


This is why I want to be a Software Engineer.
